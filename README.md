# Project1- Love Compatibility


# Description
Love calculator application. User enters their name and their Crushes name and get a percentage back How much of a match they are.
This app will provide the user with a score that indicates if two individuals are compatible based off of their names.

# Approah

Since this is my first app, I decided to take more of a simpler approach. I created a input form that accepts two names, one for the user and one for their crush. Instead of using a modal or a pop up box I used an alert box. since I was having issues connecting to the love APi Calculator server I decided to created a function that give a random percentage 1-100%.

As a user I want to be able to enter My name and then enter my Crush's or ideal mates name, so that I can receive a score or a compatibility rating that indicates whether or not we are an ideal match for eachother.

#Unsolved Issues

-I was Unable to link the form elements to the alert in the Prompt function so it would tel you the names that were entered as well as their love score.
- I was having persistent issues with connecting to the love calculator API. I was receiving timeout erros as well as 404, 405, 429 errors.

#Stretch Goals

-since I did not have time to insert a modal due to the issues i was running into I would like to implement a modal instead of a alert, so I can better customize The alert to my liking.

- I would have liked to have added css font animations to my header.
